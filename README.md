# 👋 Hello there!

I'm an LA transplant (from NY originally) and I currently work as a fullstack (React+TypeScript / Django+Python) engineer at [The Black Tux](https://theblacktux.com).

### What's happening?

- 📖 currently having a read through ["The Coding Career Handbook"](https://www.learninpublic.org/) written by [Shawn "swyx" Wang](https://www.swyx.io/)
- 💡 based off Shawn's advice on #LearnInPublic, I'm trying to brainstorm ideas on how to do this. do i want to blog? do i want to just brain dump in a Github repo? still thinking through this

### Side Projects
* ✂️ [lil-shorty](https://lil-shorty.glitch.me): first time using the Glitch platform, wanted to use newish tech and build a JS "full-stack" app
* ⏱️ [jotjik](https://jotjik.vercel.app/): stopwatch app that persists sessions to a Mongo DB instance, first time using Next.js, also wanted to integrate social auth via Google Sign-In
* 🍽️ [recipeek](https://recipeek.app): basic recipe search app, built on top of a free (but, rate-limited) 3rd API, checked off bucket list todo of implementing a "dark mode" toggle feature
